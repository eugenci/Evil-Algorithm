==================

Problem
------------------

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest
prime factor of the number 1876191413 ?

Solution 
------------------

This problem is a well known math problem of [factorization of integer
number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factorization) There are
plenty of algorithms, however because in current problem integer is
pretty small I use the a simple and yet efficent (for number of this
magnitude) [solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division).
